GRUB2 Live ISO Multiboot
========================

This version: https://github.com/cshandley-uk/bash_glim

Forked from:  https://github.com/thias/glim | https://glee.thias.es/GLIM


Overview
--------

GLIM is a set of grub configuration files to turn a simple VFAT or FAT32 
formatted USB memory stick containing many GNU/Linux distribution ISO images 
into a neat device from which many different Live environments can be used.

Advantages over extracting files or using special Live USB creation tools :

 * A single USB memory can hold all Live environments (the limit is its size)
 * ISO images stay available to burn real CDs or DVDs
 * ISO images are quick to manipulate (vs. hundreds+ files)

Disadvantages :

 * There is no persistence overlay for distributions which normally support it
 * Setting up isn't as easy as a simple cat from the ISO image to a block device

As modern Linux ISOs often exceed the 4GB file size limit of FAT32, GLIM now 
supports a second partition using other filesystems supported by GRUB2, such as 
ext3/ext4, NTFS or exFAT - but the distribution must also support booting from 
it, which isn't the case for many with NTFS (Ubuntu does, Fedora doesn't) and 
exFAT (Ubuntu doesn't, Fedora does).  Ext4 is a safe bet for the second 
partition.

Recent changes
--------------

* GLIM now easily supports ISO files >4GB through the use of a second partition,
although you can still use a single partition if you want.

* The ISO folder has been moved from `boot/iso/` to just `iso/`, so that it's 
easier to find, and also is in the same location whether you use one or two 
partitions.

* Added the `format_empty_disk.sh` script.


Requirements
------------

You need a USB memory stick (or external hard drive!) partitioned & formatted 
one of the following ways:

1. A single partition formatted as FAT32 with the filesystem label `GLIM`. 
You can use MBR or GPT as needed (but legacy BIOS may need MBR).

or

2. Two partitions.  The small first partition must be formatted as FAT32 with 
the filesystem label `GLIM`, I suggest 100MB in size.  The second partition 
should be formatted as Ext4 with the filesystem label `GLIMISO`.  

It's best if the USB stick uses MBR, but if it uses GPT (as GNOME's Disks 
utility does) then GRUB only supports installing for EFI (not BIOS) - unless you 
add a third BIOS Boot partition.  GLIM needs the BIOS Boot partition to come 
after the other two partitions.  See the link below for details on how to create 
a BIOS Boot partition:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GRUB#GUID_Partition_Table_(GPT)_specific_instructions

But basically create an unformatted 1MB partition at the end of the disk, then 
change it's partition type to "BIOS Boot" (which has the 
GUID `21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649`).  You can do this with GNOME's 
Disks utility, without resorting to the terminal!

Or if you find partitioning difficult, then you can try using my experimental 
new script `format_empty_disk.sh`, which will ask you a few questions before 
before setting-up an empty disk with GLIM's recommended two partition GPT set-up 
(plus a BIOS Boot partition), ready to use with `glim.sh` itself.  I've tried to 
make it safe, so for example it shouldn't delete any partitions, only create new 
ones... And in the event of any errors, the script should stop rather than risk 
doing anything wrong. HOWEVER, it is still a very new script, which likely 
contains bugs, especially on systems different to my own, so please let me know 
about any problems you experience.  You use this script entirely at your own 
risk.  If it formats your entire computer, then that is your problem.  So please 
make sure you have a recent backup before using it.


Installation
------------

Mount the GLIM partition (and the GLIMISO partition if present) on your USB 
memory stick (or external hard drive).

Then clone the git repository (or use Code > Download ZIP before unzipping it), 
and just run the script (as a normal user) :
```
./glim.sh
```
Once finished, you may change the filesystem label to anything you like. 
The script will have created an `iso` folder, inside of which you will see an 
empty folder for each supported Linux distro.

The supported `iso` sub-directories (in alphabetical order) are :

[//]: # (distro-list-end)

Any unpopulated directory will have the matching boot menu entry automatically
hidden, so to skip any distribution, just don't copy any files into it.

Download the right ISO image(s) to the matching directory. If you require
boot parameter tweaks, edit the appropriate `boot/grub2/inc-*.cfg` file.

Items order in the menu
-----------------------

Menu items for a distro are ordered by modification time of the iso files
starting from the most recent ones. If some iso files have the same mtime, their
menu items are ordered alphabetically.

Here is a generic idea how to keep it nicely ordered when you have multiple
releases of some distro:

- touch your **release** iso files with the release date
- touch your **point release** iso files with the original release date plus a
  day per point. This is a way to ensure point releases never pop above the next
  release like Debian 10.13.0 (released 10 Sep 2022) would still be below Debian
  11.0.0 (released 14 August 2021)
- in case there are multiple flavours of some iso but the version is the same,
  touch all of them with the same date for the whole group to be ordered
  alphabetically

Sample ordered menu:

|                                    | iso mtime               |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Debian Live 12.0.0 amd64 standard  | 10 June 2023            |
| Debian Live 11.7.0 amd64 gnome     | 14 August 2021 + 7 days |
| Debian Live 11.7.0 amd64 kde       | 14 August 2021 + 7 days |
| Debian Live 11.7.0 amd64 standard  | 14 August 2021 + 7 days |
| Debian Live 11.0.0 amd64 gnome     | 14 August 2021          |
| Debian Live 11.0.0 amd64 kde       | 14 August 2021          |
| Debian Live 11.0.0 amd64 standard  | 14 August 2021          |
| Debian Live 10.13.0 amd64 standard | 6 July 2019 + 13 days   |
| Debian Live 9.13.0 amd64 standard  | 17 June 2017 + 13 days  |

Special Cases
-------------

### iPXE

The `.iso` files don't work when booting using EFI, you simply need to use
`.efi` files instead.

### LibreELEC

LibreELEC isn't provided as ISO images, nor is it able to find the `KERNEL` and
`SYSTEM` files it needs anywhere else than at the root of a filesystem.
But it's useful to enable booting the installer by just copying both
files to the root of the USB memory stick.
Live booting is also supported, and the first launch will create a 512MB file
as /STORAGE.

### Memtest86+

The `.iso` file doesn't work. Use either the `.bin` or the `.efi` depending on
the boot mode used.

### Ubuntu

Recent Ubuntu desktop iso images bundle multiple versions on the Nvidia
driver. With that, the images are over 4GB, the FAT32 max file size. For example
`ubuntu-20.04.6-desktop-amd64.iso` is 4.1GB, `ubuntu-22.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso`
is 4.6GB. The driver is not required in a live system, it can be removed to make
an image fit into 4GB. For example, with 22.04.2 image in the current dir:

```
mkdir slim
iso=ubuntu-22.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso

xorriso -indev "$iso" -outdev slim/"$iso" \
    -boot_image any replay -rm_r /pool/restricted/{l,n} --
```

Now you can copy `slim/ubuntu-22.04.2-desktop-amd64.iso` to your FAT32 formatted
GLIM USB stick.

Some Ubuntu flavours also bundle the Nvidia driver (like Kubuntu), some don't
(like Xubuntu). The same trick can be used with the former.


Testing
-------

With KVM it should "just work". The `/dev/sdx` device should be configured as
an IDE or SATA disk (for some reason, as USB disk didn't work for me on Fedora
17), that way you can easily and quickly test changes.
Make sure you unmount the disk from the host OS before you start the KVM
virtual machine that uses it.
For UEFI testing, you'll need to use one of the `/usr/share/edk2/ovmf/*.fd`
firmwares.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If you have any problem to boot, for instance stuck at the GRUB prompt before
the menu, try re-installing.
If you have other exotic GRUB errors, such as garbage text read instead of the
configuration directives, try re-formatting your USB memory from scratch.
I've seen weird things happen...


Contributing
------------

If you find GLIM useful but the configuration of the OS you require is missing
or simply outdated, please feel free to contribute! What you will need is to
create a GitHub pull request which includes :
 * All changes properly and fully tested.
 * New entries added similarly to the existing ones :
   * In alphabetical order.
   * With all possible variants supported (i.e. not just the one spin you want).
 * An original icon of high quality, and a shrunk 24x24 png version. Using
   `convert -size 24x24 -background 'rgba(0,0,0,0)' original.svg small.png`
   may work.
 * An updated supported directories list in this README file.
